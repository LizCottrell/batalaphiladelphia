                    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                    <img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./images/border-shells.png">
                    <p>Batala Philadelphia is a non-profit Samba Reggae percussion band founded in 2017. We are part of the global Batala Mundo arts project  based in Salvador da Bahia, Brazil. </p>
                    <p>Batala Mundo was founded by Mestre Giba Gonçalves, a Bahian percussionist, in Paris in 1997. Batala Mundo is currently based out of Salvador da Bahia, Brazil, and includes over 40 bands in 15 countries, with a worldwide membership of over 1,200 drummers. </p>
                    <p>As part of the Batala Mundo community, Batala Philadelphia plays samba reggae from Bahia, composed by Mestre Gonçalves. We also play music developed by our sister band in Salvador, Cortejo Afro. </p>
                    <p>Batala Philadelphia performs at local events like parades and festivals. We also participate in Mundo events in nearby cities like New York and Washington. We also collaborate with Batala bands around the country, in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Durham. Finally, because there are Batala groups around the world, there are also opportunities for international travel, education, and collaboration.</p>

                    <h2>Mission &amp; Values</h2>
                    <img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./images/border-shells.png">
                    <blockquote>"Batala Philadelphia’s mission is to enrich and inspire our communities by providing an Afro-Brazillian musical and cultural experience. We accomplish this goal through arts education and live performances. Our distinct form of musical expression and cultural heritage from Salvador da Bahia, Brazil is open to all individuals regardless of experience or background."</blockquote>
                    <p>Batala Mundo was founded to spread Afro-Brazilian culture and music to communities across the world. Central to Batala Mundo’s core is the belief that music is universal and that anyone can learn to play, given the chance. As part of Batala Mundo, Batala Philadelphia strives to carry out the goals of our global organization and sister bands. <strong>We believe that music is inspirational. It enriches our lives and communities through arts education, performance, inclusiveness, and excitement.</strong></p>
                    <p>Batala Philadelphia is part of a rich, collaborative, and diverse international musical collective. <strong>Through accepting and celebrating the differences and diversity within our Mundo community, we truly embody the spirit and intention of Batala.</strong></p>
                    <p>Batala Philadelphia recognizes that we are based in one of the most historic cities in the United States. By accepting and celebrating the character and history of Philadelphia, <strong>we aim to create an open community in which cultural exchange, ongoing learning, and diversity are valued as core principles.</strong></p>
                    <p>To this end, Batala Philadelphia borrows heavily from Philadelphia’s strong Quaker tradition in adopting a set of band and community standards based on trust, concern, respect, and personal accountability.</p>
                    <p>For our diverse community to prosper, <strong>we embrace our differences and are mindful of our varied perspectives and backgrounds.</strong> Members strive to seek mutual understanding by means of respectful communication.</p>
                    <p>We uphold the Batala Philadelphia community standards by engaging with values upon which our community depends: mutual trust, concern, and respect for oneself, one another and the community. <strong>We are one band, one community, one family, and we are responsible to ourselves and to each other. We teach and learn from one another, we are not afraid to ask for or offer help, and we value inclusion and kindness.</strong></p>
